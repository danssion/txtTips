"The big economic difference between nuclear and fossil-fuelled power
stations is that nuclear reactors are more expensive to build and
decommission, but cheaper to sun. So disputes over the relative efficiency of
 the two
systems revolve not just around prices of coal and uranium today and tomorrow,
 but also around the way in which future income should be compared with
current income."

Algorithms
* What's the difference between a linked list and an array?
* Implement an algorithm to sort a linked list. Why did you pick the
method you did?
* Implement an algorithm to sort an array. Why did you pick the method
you did?
* Implement strstr() (or some other string library function).
* Reverse a string. Optimize for speed. Optimize for space.
* Count the number of set bits in a number. Now optimize for speed.
Now optimize for size.
* How would you find a cycle in a linked list?
* Give me an algorithm to shuffle a deck of cards, given that the
cards are stored in an array of ints.
* Write a function that takes in a string parameter and checks to see
whether or not it is an integer, and if it is then return the integer value.
* Write a function to print all of the permutations of a string.
* Implement malloc.
* Write a function to print the Fibonacci numbers.
* Write a function to copy two strings, A and B. The last few bytes of
string A overlap the first few bytes of string B.

doing it?
* If MS told you we were willing to invest $5 million in a start up of
your choice, what business would you start? Why?
* If you could gather all of the computer manufacturers in the world
together into one room and then tell them one thing that they would be
compelled to do, what would it be?
* Explain a scenario for testing a salt shaker.
* If you are going to receive an award in 5 years, what is it for and
who is the audience?
